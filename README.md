# Dark Patterns Identification - Chrome Extension

## Overview
The **Dark Patterns Identification** Chrome extension aims to help users identify and understand dark patterns used on websites. Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs that trick users into doing things they might not want to do, such as subscribing to a service or sharing more personal data than intended. This extension empowers users to make informed decisions by highlighting potential dark patterns in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection:** Analyzes the structure and behavior of web pages to detect common dark patterns.
- **User Alerts:** Notifies users when a dark pattern is identified.
- **Educational Insights:** Provides descriptions and examples of the identified dark patterns.

## Supported Dark Patterns
The extension currently detects the following types of dark patterns:
- **Countdoun:** A dark pattern that creates a false sense of urgency by showing a timer or deadline, pressuring users to act quickly without adequate time for thoughtful decision-making.
- **Scarcity:** A tactic that manipulates users by implying that a product or offer is limited or running out, urging immediate action. For example, showing "Only 1 left in stock!" even if it's not true.
- **Social Proof:** A pattern that makes it difficult for users to cancel a subscription or service by burying the cancelation option or requiring multiple steps.
- **Forced  Community:** The deliberate use of ambiguous or misleading language to trick users into agreeing to something they might not want, such as pre-checked boxes or double negatives.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the front-end.
- **Manifest v3** for Chrome extension configuration.
